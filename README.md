## Background
This project is aim to make a simple standalone music player with GUI in the DCS World's mod. It contains two parts which are: in-game avionic code and music converter & config generator code.

To allow the simplest usage of both code, the avionic side uses the lua with logic of the avionic system and sound system. It can be simply integrated into any mod. The convert/config side use the c++ with win32api to create a portable execute file.

Serval Libiaries are used to collect the media metadata and convert the media into game supported format. The lib license info can be checked in the [License](#license).
